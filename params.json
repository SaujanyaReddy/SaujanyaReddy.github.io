The majority of current approaches, however, attempt to detect\r\nthe overall polarity of a sentence, paragraph, or text span, regardless of the entities\r\nmentioned (e.g., laptops, restaurants) and their aspects (e.g., battery, screen ; food,\r\nservice). By contrast, this task is concerned with aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA),\r\nwhere the goal is to identify the aspects of given target entities and the sentiment\r\nexpressed towards each aspect.\r\n\r\n###Problem Statement\r\n---\r\nThis task is concerned with aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA), where the goal is to identify the aspects of given target entities and the sentiment expressed towards each aspect.\r\n\r\n###Challenges Faced\r\n---\r\n* Aspect term extraction,\r\n* We used rule based method, and some of the aspect terms weren’t\r\nextracted correctly by the rules.\r\n* We assumed all sentences are grammatically correct which is not always\r\nthe real life scenario.\r\n* Aspect term polarity,\r\n* In sentences with many aspect terms, it was difficult to assign polarity.\r\n\r\n###Dataset\r\n---\r\nWe used the SemEval 2016 dataset available\r\nat: ​\r\nhttp://metashare.ilsp.gr:8080/repository/browse/semeval-2014-absa-restaurant-reviews-trial-data/1790ab94464211e388f5842b2b6a04d79bb0323cac4f49939bf5b99878dc38be/\r\nThis dataset consists of restaurant reviews presented in an XML file.\r\nContains around 100 reviews, with varied number of aspect terms in each.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Tools Used\r\n---\r\n* Stanford CoreNLP Parser\r\n* NLTK\r\n\r\n##Phases of the Project\r\n###Phase 1\r\nTask 1\r\n* Aspect term Extraction\r\nThis task deals with extracting the aspect terms from the reviews. ​\r\nGiven a set of sentences with pre-identified entities (e.g., restaurants), identify the aspect terms present\r\nin the sentence and return a list containing all the distinct aspect terms. An aspect term\r\nnames a particular aspect of the target entity.\r\n\r\nTask2\r\n* Aspect Polarity Detection\r\nFor a given set of aspect terms within a sentence, determine whether the polarity of each aspect term is positive, negative, neutral or conflict (i.e., both positive and negative).\r\n\r\n###Phase 2\r\nTask 2\r\n* Given a predefined set of aspect categories (e.g., price, food), identify the aspect categories discussed in a given sentence. Aspect categories are typically coarser than the aspect terms of Subtask 1, and they do not necessarily occur as terms in the given sentence.\r\n\r\nTask 4\r\n* Given a set of pre-identified aspect categories (e.g., {food, price}), determine the polarity (positive, negative, neutral ​or conflict) of each aspect category.\r\n\r\n###Results\r\n---\r\nThe system was run on SemEval 2016 dataset for restaurant reviews.\r\nThe evaluation outputs are obtained as follows.\r\n###For Aspect Terms\r\n\r\nAspects\r\n* System Aspect Terms=747\r\n* Gold Aspect Terms=737\r\n* Pre: 0.2570281 (192/747)\r\n* Rec: 0.2605156 (192/737)\r\n* F:0.2587601\r\n\r\nCategories\r\n\r\n* System Aspect Categories=570\r\n* Gold Aspect Categories=752\r\n* Pre: 0.36666667 (209/570)\r\n* Rec: 0.27792552 (209/752)\r\n* F:0.3161876\r\n\r\n###For polarity\r\n\r\nAspects\r\n* Accuracy: 0.44791666(86/92)\r\n\r\nlabel\\measure | Precision | Recall | F-measure |\r\n-----|----------|-------|------|\r\nconflict | NaN(0/0) | 0(0/6) |NaN |\r\nnegative |0.3333(11/33) |0.3235(11/34) |0.3284 |\r\nneutral |0.1389(10/72) |0.5(10/20) |0.2174 |\r\npositive |0.7471(65/87) |0.4924(65/132) |0.5936 |\r\n\r\n\r\nCategories\r\n* Accuracy: 0.3110048 (65/209)\r\n\r\nlabel\\measure |Precision |Recall |F-measure |\r\n----|-----|------|---|\r\nconflict |NaN(0/0) |0(0/9) |NaN |\r\nnegative |0.2143(6/28) |0.1667(6/36) |0.1875 |\r\nneutral |0.087(10/115) |0.5(10/20) |0.1481 |\r\npositive |0.7424(49/66) |0.3403(49/144) |0.4667 |\r\n\r\n###Tags\r\n---\r\n* IIIT HYDERABAD.\r\n* Information Retrieval and Extraction\r\n* Major Project\r\n* Restaurant Reviews\r\n* Reviews\r\n* Sentiment Analysis\r\n* Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis\r\n* Rule based\r\n* Stanford CoreNLP \r\n\r\nThe source code is available at: \r\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/SaujanyaReddy/Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis-IRE-Major-Project.git)\r\nVideo explaining the project is at: \r\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2KT4-zuPwU)\r\nSlideshare ppt is at: \r\n* [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/IndranilMukherjee20/absa-project-60961283)\r\nDropBox link(has video, ppt,and report of the project):\r\n* [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/krpv30cwdakgr90/AAC-cQ-Vgkm1OpWaokZIEZlba) \r\n",
